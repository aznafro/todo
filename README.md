# Todo List App

A Todo App that saves data using local storage. I wanted to give it more of a mobile/tablet app feel, so instead of simply replacing pieces of the UI when buttons are pressed to access projects, I added a zoom in/out effect on components. I also wanted to make it look drastcally different from other Todo apps by adding a glaring red background and theme throughout the app as well as transparent views.

I tried to make this project as modular as possible separating out pieces of the code to handle specific parts of the app.
